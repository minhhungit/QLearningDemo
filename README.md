# Q-Learning Demo: Cat and Mouse Chase

Welcome to the Q-Learning demonstration! In this demo, we'll illustrate how Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm, can be applied to a simple scenario where a cat attempts to catch a mouse while avoiding a dog. Please note that this is a simplified example designed to showcase the Q-Learning algorithm.

## Overview

Q-Learning is a model-free, reinforcement learning algorithm used to find the optimal action-selection policy for a given Markov decision process. In this demo, we'll simulate a scenario where a cat, represented by the agent, navigates a grid world to catch a mouse while avoiding a dog.
